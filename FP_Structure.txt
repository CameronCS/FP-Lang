This file will contain sorce code and attempts to do things it multiple languages.

FP the lang developed by cameron stocks

Attempts will be made in the following langauges:
	C
	C++
	C#
	Java
	Python
	(Maybe Assembly... i Dont know)


Types:
FP will contain the following types
character				-> char
string				-> str
integer 				-> int
floating point values 	-> float
boolean 				-> bool

Entry:
	Possibly will be a main.

pointers? maybe.

syntax:

loop syntax:
	if statements:
		if (cond) {}

	while loops:
		while (cond) {}

	do-while -> exec_while
		exec {} while(cond)
		

	for loops
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {}
	or 
		for (string s $ collection) {}


var syntax:
	All none segemented blocks will end in a semi-colon.
	init:
		[type] <name> = {val} ;
	short-hand
		[type] <name>;
	
function Syntax:
	proc <name>() ~ [type] {}
	proc main() ~ int {}
	proc foo() ~ void {}

AST -> Abstract Syntax Tree:
	var -> 
		name
		type
		val

	proc ->
		name
		params
		ret-type
		body<sub_routines>

Interpreted or Compiled?

On Init:
	Interpreted
On Stable Parsing
	Compiled

Built-ins? 
	Yes. Such as -> Print

Removal of builtins?
	Yes. Have prebuilt linking -> C Style

Headers?
	Maybe -> Like the Style

Extensions ->
	.fp -> code file
	.fph -> Header
